1,,Sub-task,Deploy all client release build to integration,gcattin,Must,Done,"These steps are now part of the Int01 automation that runs the weekend following the close of the last sprint of a release:
# Create the release branch that will host the release build and deployment.
# Stop the VisitPayProcessor for each client in integration (Int01/02)
# Purge the Rabbit queues for each client in integration (Int01-02)
# Refresh Int01/Int02 DBs with production before deploying new release for regression.
# Once Int01/02 have been refreshed, deploy production packages into Int01/02 so as to have a clean starting point prior to deploying the actual release build into Int01/02. Do this for all involved clients.
# Create release packages
# Deploy release packages

3,,Sub-task,Deploy release build to Training environment for all clients,gcattin,Won't,Done,"By default this is done via the automation, but it has been commented out for now due to the desire to control what goes to training when. Now that we deploy more often, it is easy to trample on a client training session, thus this separate card.

Talk to Tani or Jack to determine when it is appropriate to deploy the release build to training. Make sure to include QATools. You may need to be added to the approver's role for Training and demo to deploy there.

•	Determine for each card the extent of the required testing
•	Determine the mechanism by which test tracking will occur (above links share Legacy mechanism)
•	Document the testing that will occur
o	Assign who will be testing
	This will typically be a QA team member or a DQM member; for facilitating SLHS testing, this might be a Prod Support member
o	State where testing will occur
o	State the scope of testing that will occur

1.	Items with the same number can run concurrently, i.e. for items numbered 3, the Multi packages can all be launched together.

Chris, please add a story to Intermountain Alpha backlog for this task.  It will require coordination between Dev, QA, and DQM to enable.
